## Question 1. What were the main issues in the Reinhard and Rogoff issue, and how best could they have been avoided?

### The main issues with the Reinhard and Rogoff affair were based on the analysis of their data which was tagged as being inaccurate and somewhat misleading, especially to those who are depending on these data to make policy changes. Additionally, relying and building upon their published results continues the inaccuracy in future economic analyses. An audit of their publication highlighted some of the inaccuracies and cautions that should be taken when using certain data analysis tools such as Microsoft Excel. Based on the critiques of their work, these mistakes could have been avoided by determining the limitations of the tools being used, ensuring reproducibiity of the results and determining what are the possible results or output based on including and excluding some data points.

## Question 2. What key attributes make a piece of data analysis "reproducible"? Please put those attributes in a prioritized list (i.e., for you, what is most important, next most important, etc...)

### Some of the key attributes of reproducible data analysis includes:

1.  Accurately taking notes of the steps and/or following the protocol for lab work.

2.  Accurately reporting the raw data and interpretations.

3.  Making notes of all equipment, reagents and versions of software being used.

## Question 3. Imagine that you are doing a piece of data analysis that only you will ever see: perhaps you are shopping for a car and trying to determine what will give you the best value for your money. Should you think about making your data analysis reproducible? Why or why not?

### I would make my data analysis reproducible to assess whether the criteria used can be applied in other instances such as purchasing a home or purchasing organically grown apples versus conventionally grown apples, etc.
